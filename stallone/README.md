# stallone

Yet another actor implementation. Inspired by Akka and Erlang/OTP.

WIP and very rough around the edges. Don't use unless you feel comfortable digging through the code.

## Getting Started

Check back later...

## TODO
- Logging
- Supervision.
- Allow passing ActorRefs across Isolates.
- Combine request id with ref id/name to make sure that responses go to the right ref (eg. if the 
  ref has been copied).
- Basically everything.
