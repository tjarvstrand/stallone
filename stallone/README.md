# Stallone

Yet another actor implementation. Inspired by Akka and Erlang/OTP.

Very much a WIP and very rough around the edges. Don't try to use unless you
feel comfortable digging through the code.

## Getting Started

Check back later...

## TODO
- Rename Actor and break out a new Actor class that is more of a basic building block
- Supervision
- Allow passing ActorRefs across Isolates
- Basically everything...
